# Khmer News Classifier - Deployment Summary

## 🎯 Optimized Deployment Strategy

Your deployment has been optimized for **efficiency** and **reliability**:

### ✅ What's Changed:

- **FastText model is downloaded directly on the server** (not uploaded)
- **Saves 2.8GB of upload bandwidth**
- **Faster and more reliable deployment**
- **Multiple fallback download methods**

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy

### Quick Start:

```bash
cd /Users/socheata/Documents/DEV
./upload_to_droplet.sh YOUR_DROPLET_IP root
```

### Available Scripts:

1. **`check_deployment_ready.sh`** - Verify all files are ready
2. **`upload_to_droplet.sh`** - Main deployment script
3. **`download_fasttext_model.sh`** - Standalone FastText model download

### Deployment Process:

1. **Upload Phase** (~3-5 minutes):

   - Application files
   - SVM model files
   - Configuration files
   - Dependencies installation

2. **Download Phase** (~10-15 minutes):

   - FastText model downloaded directly on server
   - Multiple fallback methods ensure success
   - Automatic verification and permissions

3. **Setup Phase** (~2-3 minutes):
   - SystemD service configuration
   - Nginx reverse proxy setup
   - Application startup

## 📁 What Gets Deployed:

### Uploaded from Local:

- `khmer_news_classifier_pro.py` (main app)
- `requirements.txt` (Python dependencies)
- `Demo_model/` (SVM model files)
- `Khmer-Stop-Word-1000.txt` (stopwords)
- `deployment_configs/` (server configs)

### Downloaded on Server:

- `cc.km.300.bin` (FastText model, 2.8GB)

## 🔧 Advanced Usage:

### Re-download FastText Model Only:

```bash
./download_fasttext_model.sh YOUR_DROPLET_IP root
```

### Check Deployment Status:

```bash
ssh root@YOUR_DROPLET_IP 'systemctl status khmer-classifier'
```

### View Application Logs:

```bash
ssh root@YOUR_DROPLET_IP 'journalctl -u khmer-classifier -f'
```

## 🌐 After Deployment:

1. **Access your app**: `http://YOUR_DROPLET_IP`
2. **Set up SSL** (optional): Use deployment configs
3. **Monitor logs**: Check application health
4. **Domain setup** (optional): Configure DNS

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting:

### If FastText download fails:

- Run the standalone download script
- Check server internet connection
- Model will work with SVM-only if needed

### If deployment fails:

- Check SSH connection
- Verify droplet has enough RAM (4GB recommended)
- Review logs for specific errors

## 📋 Files Ready for Deployment:

✅ All critical files verified and ready
✅ All scripts are executable
✅ Documentation updated
✅ Optimized for server-side FastText download

**You're ready to deploy! 🎉**
