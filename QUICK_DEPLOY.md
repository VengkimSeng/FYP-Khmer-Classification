# Quick Deployment Guide

## Ready to Deploy! ðŸš€

Your Khmer News Classifier is ready for deployment to your DigitalOcean droplet.

### What You Need:

1. **Your Droplet IP Address** - Get this from your DigitalOcean dashboard
2. **SSH Access** - Make sure you can SSH to your droplet

### Deploy in 3 Simple Steps:

#### Step 1: Get Your Droplet IP

- Log into your DigitalOcean dashboard
- Find your droplet's public IP address
- Example: `192.168.1.100`

#### Step 2: Deploy the Application

```bash
cd /Users/socheata/Documents/DEV
./upload_to_droplet.sh YOUR_DROPLET_IP root
```

Replace `YOUR_DROPLET_IP` with your actual IP address.

#### Step 3: Access Your Application

- Open your browser
- Go to: `http://YOUR_DROPLET_IP`
- Your Khmer News Classifier should be running!

### Example Deployment Command:

```bash
./upload_to_droplet.sh 192.168.1.100 root
```

### What the Script Does:

1. âœ… Tests SSH connection
2. âœ… Creates application directory structure
3. âœ… Uploads application files (no FastText model upload)
4. âœ… Installs Python dependencies
5. âœ… Downloads FastText model directly on server
6. âœ… Sets up systemd service
7. âœ… Configures nginx reverse proxy
8. âœ… Starts the application
9. âœ… Verifies deployment

### Deployment Time:

- **File uploads**: ~2-3 minutes
- **FastText model download**: ~10-20 minutes (server downloads directly)
- **Total**: ~15-25 minutes

### Advantages of Server-Side Download:

- ðŸš€ **Faster deployment** - No need to upload 2.8GB model
- ðŸ’° **Saves bandwidth** - Server downloads directly from FastText
- ðŸ”„ **More reliable** - Server has better connection than your laptop

### After Deployment:

- Your app will be accessible at `http://YOUR_DROPLET_IP`
- All browser storage functionality will work
- Application auto-starts on server reboot
- Logs available via: `journalctl -u khmer-classifier -f`

### Troubleshooting:

If something goes wrong, check the detailed guide in `DROPLET_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`

### Optional: Set Up Domain & SSL

After deployment, you can:

1. Point a domain to your droplet IP
2. Set up SSL certificate using the included scripts

**You're all set! Run the deployment command when ready.**
