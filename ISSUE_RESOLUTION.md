# FastText Loading Issue - Resolution Summary

## Problem Description

The Khmer News Classifier was failing to load the FastText model with the error:

```
❌ Error loading FastText model: cannot import name 'triu' from 'scipy.linalg'
```

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by version incompatibility between `gensim` and `scipy`. The system had:

- **scipy 1.13.1** (too new)
- **gensim 4.3.3** (compatible)

In newer versions of scipy (1.11+), the `triu` function was moved or removed from `scipy.linalg`, which gensim's FastText implementation relies on.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Dependency Version Fix

- **Downgraded scipy** from 1.13.1 to 1.10.1
- **Maintained gensim** at 4.3.3 (compatible version)
- **Installed unicodedata2** for better text processing

### 2. Code Improvements

- Enhanced error handling in `load_models()` function
- Added fallback embedding method when FastText is unavailable
- Improved user feedback with detailed error messages and fix suggestions

### 3. Tools Created

- **`fix_dependencies.py`** - Automated dependency fixing script
- **`check_system_status.py`** - Comprehensive system diagnostics
- **Updated `requirements.txt`** - Pinned compatible versions

## Current Status

✅ **RESOLVED** - FastText model now loads successfully

## Verified Working Components

- ✅ SVM model loading
- ✅ FastText model loading
- ✅ scipy.linalg.triu import
- ✅ All text processing functions
- ✅ Streamlit application startup

## Compatible Versions (Tested)

```
scipy==1.10.1
gensim==4.3.3
numpy==1.26.4
streamlit==1.45.1
scikit-learn==1.6.1
```

## Prevention for Future

The `requirements.txt` has been updated with version constraints:

```
gensim>=4.2.0,<4.4.0
scipy>=1.7.0,<1.11.0
```

## Usage

The application is now fully functional:

```bash
streamlit run khmer_news_classifier_pro.py
```

Access at: http://localhost:8501

## Additional Notes

- The system includes graceful fallback handling if FastText becomes unavailable
- All model files are present and working (SVM: 13MB, FastText: 2.8GB)
- 15,000 preprocessed articles available for testing
